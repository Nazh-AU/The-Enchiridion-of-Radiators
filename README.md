### Introduction and Intention

Welcome! The intention of this document is to have an ongoing repository for the testing of the many radiators that are recommended for SFF. There's a substantial amount of anecdotal evidence floating around in regards to radiator choice, fan choice and the arrangement of both. With testing and comparison, I hope that this document can serve to inform and guide the choices for SFF Watercooling.

I do feel that I want to establish that the testing conducted is intentionally niche for a few reasons. The radiators and fans tested will largely revolve around compatibility with Sandwich layout cases, Primarily the FormD T1V2. The testing configurations will reflect the compatibility of the T1V2 or similar Sandwich layout cases, i.e. Jimu. This will include the more popular recommended radiators, Fan orientations and the feasibility of Dual Radiator Layouts. That's not to say that I won't test other radiators and fans in the future, I would in fact love to have a large volume of information on the many offerings outside the ones stated. It just isn't a current priority.

The extent of the configurations of Radiator, Fans and Radiator Layout will be elaborated on in later sections. I plan to make all the information as palatable as possible so that all can make use of it. If you have any suggestions or questions, please don't hesitate to reach out, All input is appreciated.

Thank you for your time,

### Test Setup

The test setup used will be as follows for all of the tests conducted unless stated otherwise.

- 11900KF with Barrow pump-block combo and an EK DDC3.2 Elite
- Gigabyte Z590i Aorus ITX motherboard
- GTX 770 With EK-FC770 GTX DCII - Acetal+Nickel
- G.Skill Trident Z 32GB 3600MHz DDR4 
- Samsung 970 EVO 500GB NVMe Drive
- Corsair SF750 SFX PSU
- GECKO AIR ITX

Fans and Radiators will be changed as needed so they won't be invluded in this list. The fittings used are pneumatic air fittings with an 8mm airline tube to a set of QDC's at the radiator end. I do plan to do a chapter on the use of pnematic fittings in the future as many may be uneasy about their use and understandably so. The testing that I and others have done shows now reason why theyre aren't adequate and in my opinion I believe them to be superior to the bulky offerings available for SFF. 

The radiator is housed in a T1 chassis with no components in it in order to isolate from the system component's passive heat. This helps to ensure the load generated by the CPU and GPU are what the radiator is dissapating which will give better results. The other reason I have decided to house the radiator end of the loop in a T1 chassis is so that I can install the top and side panels in order to create a better representation of the radiators in real world situations. The objective testing doesn't use top or side panels in order to give a truer represtation of what the radiator can do.

As will be explained in the Testing Methodology, There is a set of variables that I aim to keep consistant across the testing. Mainly ambient temperature through the use of AC and Temp Probes as well as multiple coolant temperature sampling points (in order to calculate Coolant Delta). All data logging will be done through an Aquacomputer QUADRO Fan Controller. As you will see further down, This piece of equipment is crucial to this test setup and acts as the backbone to the majority of the data and values that will be represented. 

### Testing Methodology

I would like to use this section to walk you through the theory of my testing and hopefully get you to a place by the end that will give you an intuitive understanding on how to interpret the data I present. I will do this through several stages as a way to refine my own testing methodology, So this may change by the end of writting.
